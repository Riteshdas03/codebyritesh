# 👋 Hey, I’m Ritesh Das – Welcome to My Portfolio 🚀

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work, projects, skills, and learning journey. I built this site from scratch using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It’s lightweight, responsive, and super fast thanks to Vite.

I created this project to have a central place for everything I’ve done — from development projects and achievements to what I’m currently learning.
